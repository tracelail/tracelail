**Senior Associate Scientist (Computational Genetics Mentorship)**
*BridgeBio Gene Therapy | Raleigh, May 2023 - Present*

- Completed bioinformatics RNA sequencing differential gene expression and gene ontology analytics project of mouse brain tissue via Jupyter notebook.
- Created a GitHub repository that aggregates and transforms data from cell culture passaging production bioreactors and analytical assays into an R shiny dashboard.
- Used AWS EC2 instance for project development and OOP to generate custom plasmid GTF files for nf-core RNAseq pipeline analysis.

**Senior Associate Scientist**
*BridgeBio Gene Therapy | Raleigh, Jan 2023 - Present*

- Demonstrated potential and dedication for data science by writing scripts for real-time bioreactor data transformation.
- Designed and managed execution of small scale program screening and optimization experiments resulting in 3x vg titer increase while reducing residuals.
- Screened innovative biologics and technologies for drug development.

**Scientific Associate II**
*BridgeBio Gene Therapy | Raleigh, Apr 2021 - Jan 2023*

- Utilized Python and R for data management analytics and visualization.
- Conducted cell culture of HEK293 cells for AAV gene therapies.
- Collaborated across teams and departments for AAV gene therapy drug candidates development.

**Scientific Associate I**
